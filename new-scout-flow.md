# Auto - has timer

## Starting position

## leaving/driving to position (whole field overlay)

## Game piece pick up option

## Scoring place

## Drop piece

# Teleop

## Defense/Amplify - these can be freform input question -- thus they can represent any action at a point in time
### It would be good to pin the location this action happened on the field/option to not. 

## Game Piece Pick Up Location
### Game Piece action afterwards (scoring, lobbing, dropped) -- need to find a way to incoporate shooting location

# Post match question form

# To Do this

Im thinking making a question flow. i.e. a series of questions that happen in an order and can display after one another. 
There will be a field form with image
You can assign questions a shaped block that is on the field with an icon, this has an x,y coordiante.
